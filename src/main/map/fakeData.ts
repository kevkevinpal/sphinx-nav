    text: "where I really think Taproot shines. So just kind of laying the groundwork there with Lightning Network is why I think tap route is massively valuable. And one of the big things that it's going to enable is that we won't be able to see what is a Lightning Channel and what is not anymore. We will not be able to just point at the bitcoin chain and be like, this is a Lightning Channel. This is a Lightning channel. Opening, opening, opening, closing, closing, closing. This is how big the Lightning Network is. That is the Lightning Network is going to get harder and harder to tell what the hell is going on because Taproot enables obscuring all of the signature and script data. So I talked about earlier that if you have a single from address and a to address and I just have one key signing it, that's one signature. Well, if I have a one address to from address to a two address and I have a two of three multi SIG, it shows all three of the signatures that need to be met and has a little script that says if two, then you're good to go. This is valid if two of three and then signatures underneath it is met. So that's a lot of data. Tap, root and snore signatures. This is essentially what makes Taproot possible. It's a new signature scheme. Makes it possible to have all of that be a single signature. And whether or not two people signed it, whether or not one person signed it, whether or not 50 people signed it, it is still a single signature, and it looks identical to any other Taproot transaction. So if it's a multi signature, two of two with a Lightning channel, doesn't look any different than a regular transaction. If it's a five of seven vault transaction with a standard five or seven multi SIG and then a time lock clause that if it's not met after 100 days. You can unlock it with this two of three signature. All of that wrapped up into a single. Like what would be normally a really long. Incredibly data heavy signature and script looks like any other transaction. Just a single script and whatever inputs to whatever outputs would look just as if one person signed it. And now some people say, oh, goody scaling. We can fit a couple more transactions in per block. I don't care about that. I mean, it's cool. Great. Cheaper transactions, also very good. This is a decent improvement. We want to be as efficient as possible with how much data we have to put on chain. But the two places where this really shines are validation time, the amount of computation it takes to prove that the signature has been met. I mean, think about it. If you've got a five of seven, you have to validate five things if it's signed properly and then run through the whole script, whatever it is, Taproot not only is the signature itself faster to validate, but it's only one signature. So if you've ever done a full sync of a bitcoin node, you know that the first 200,000 blocks fly. Like, just fly. Why? Because they're mostly empty. They're just barely a handful of transactions. You know, it's only like block I don't know, what was it? Shit, I'm not going to know. When the Genesis transaction was made, when the very first transaction was made to how. And I'm very upset. I have failed as Guy Swan. I have fallen from the throne. I'm going to have to go to my own calendar on the crypto economy.com calendar, alright? And command F transaction. There you are. Genesis transaction day, block 170. All this for just a random side point. Block 170 was the very first transaction that happened where Satoshi sent to halfini ten bitcoin. So this and the incredibly light, almost nonexistent use of bitcoin for the first 200,000 or so blocks, they just fly in the sync process because there's so little data to validate. And it's just easy. The computer just zips right through it. But then you start getting into like blocks 300,000 and stuff, and you're starting to see blocks all consistently have transactions and some big transactions like start to come in. And then you'll notice when you're in 4000 and 5000, it's slowing to a crawl. That's because you have to validate it all. You have to validate all the signatures, you have to run through all the scripts and all this stuff. And of course, the blocks got bigger too. So this was one of the things about SegWit that was actually kind of contentious, was that it does add a lot more data to validate, and this threatens Bitcoin's decentralization. It threatens the network resilience to recover. If a bug happens or something, bunch of nodes go down, or if there's a great firewall of China lockdown on being able to send Bitcoin information like et cetera, et cetera. We want to be able to bring up brand new nodes in the case that something goes wrong, or in the case that we add 20 million users. You don't want them to be dependent on the same. You want subsequently a ton more nodes when there are a ton more users on the network. Otherwise it's increasingly getting centralized to just bitcoin maximalists validating the network. And we don't want that. We want everyone to be validating. The network, all services, all businesses, everybody who has a substantial amount of savings. We want as many nodes as possible, so that's continuing to get harder and continuing to require more and more computational power is not a good thing. This is where Tap root ",

    text: "changes this. Tap root is a huge improvement and basically checks off the last piece of the box for the desirable smart contract platform. Tap Root essentially turns all of the arrangements, the different branches and all of the participants in a multi SIG contract in any smart contract, no matter how complex, and basically boils it all down to just a public key. So all of the specific participants and possible outcomes of the contract are invisible. And the only time that anything is exposed, even during all the cooperative arrangements or the cooperative exits and exchanges of any sort of Taproot based contract, you don't see anything. You still just see the public key. None of the details are ever exposed. It is only in the case that you have to use a branch of it in contesting the contract to enforce it. In the case of a non cooperative exit, it's kind of like a Lightning channel, right? You don't have to use there's this branch where you have to enforce your ownership if the other party cheats you. But if you don't have to use that, you both just sign with the latest state and withdraw your coins from the channel. Taproot is kind of like that. As long as the parties that need to sign agree on the outcome of the contract, well, everybody can just sign and it's just a public key. But if someone needs to enforce their branch because the parties disappeared or they have a backup clause because somebody lost their keys, someone needs to go to a lawyer who is part of this multi SIG and they need to sign to enforce some arrangement because they didn't deliver on their 1 million glass iPhone covers, whatever the hell it is. Well then that one branch needs to be exposed in order to enforce it. But all the other potential branches, all the other lawyers that may have had keys involved in this, all the other backup clauses for all of the other participants, none of that needs to be revealed, just the branch that was needed in order to produce a mathematically valid signature. So it's going to be really interesting to see what gets built with this and it's awesome to kind of see that last check box, right? Like we need privacy in the smart contracts. And Nick Zabo laid out what the hope was for a way to issue these things. And Bitcoin is a profound innovation when it comes to the idea of an arbiter for a smart contract in money, for a monetary contract and to see something, to have something written back in, I think it was 1996, and see where we are today in the ability to see it come to fruition.

      text: "changes this. Tap root is a huge improvement and basically checks off the last piece of the box for the desirable smart contract platform. Tap Root essentially turns all of the arrangements, the different branches and all of the participants in a multi SIG contract in any smart contract, no matter how complex, and basically boils it all down to just a public key. So all of the specific participants and possible outcomes of the contract are invisible. And the only time that anything is exposed, even during all the cooperative arrangements or the cooperative exits and exchanges of any sort of Taproot based contract, you don't see anything. You still just see the public key. None of the details are ever exposed. It is only in the case that you have to use a branch of it in contesting the contract to enforce it. In the case of a non cooperative exit, it's kind of like a Lightning channel, right? You don't have to use there's this branch where you have to enforce your ownership if the other party cheats you. But if you don't have to use that, you both just sign with the latest state and withdraw your coins from the channel. Taproot is kind of like that. As long as the parties that need to sign agree on the outcome of the contract, well, everybody can just sign and it's just a public key. But if someone needs to enforce their branch because the parties disappeared or they have a backup clause because somebody lost their keys, someone needs to go to a lawyer who is part of this multi SIG and they need to sign to enforce some arrangement because they didn't deliver on their 1 million glass iPhone covers, whatever the hell it is. Well then that one branch needs to be exposed in order to enforce it. But all the other potential branches, all the other lawyers that may have had keys involved in this, all the other backup clauses for all of the other participants, none of that needs to be revealed, just the branch that was needed in order to produce a mathematically valid signature. So it's going to be really interesting to see what gets built with this and it's awesome to kind of see that last check box, right? Like we need privacy in the smart contracts. And Nick Zabo laid out what the hope was for a way to issue these things. And Bitcoin is a profound innovation when it comes to the idea of an arbiter for a smart contract in money, for a monetary contract and to see something, to have something written back in, I think it was 1996, and see where we are today in the ability to see it come to fruition. It's really just kind of amazing.

    text: "some Taproot man. Like, you've got the hashtag in your Twitter handle now, hashtag Taproot 2020. So I did the same and want to try to spread that idea around. We need to get this thing going. Right. So why is tapper so important to get out sooner than later? I genuinely think that I still want a lot of new development and new features to come to the Bitcoin chain, like on chain, that obviously would require softworks. But as far as authentication of the code goes, I think if we got Taproot I would be okay with Ossifying after that if we couldn't get anything else in. Because I think what's increasingly going to happen is that contracts and signatures and the scripts that are involved in these things and the encumbrances of attaching a public key or signing with a hash of some other data or some other secret or the output of some other program or something into the signature of a transaction. I think those things are going to become so widespread that it's important that we make those as efficient. Private. And capable as possible. Absolutely. And right now, you basically have to tell the Bitcoin chain all of the possible scripts. You have to write this huge tree, and you have to publish this whole tree to the Bitcoin blockchain, which means it costs a fortune. It's a massive data hog. And more importantly, not only is it a data hog that's expensive for the person issuing the transaction, but it's also a huge burden on the computation of validating the chain. Yes. After you get to multi SIG and like Lightning network and all of these transactions. While you're syncing up a node. All the empty blocks up to block 200,000 or something like that go in like an hour. They like it just plows through all of them. And then it starts to slow down for another 200,000 when blocks are kind of full and you're getting full like 1 MB blocks and stuff. And we're kind of getting to that period where transactions are really heavy, but then you kind of get into the complex transactions and those last blocks, just your computer has to churn. It really slows down as time goes on because transactions are getting more and more complex. Cap root is both a huge boost to the validation. It's a huge efficiency and cost savings to the chain in not having to publish all of that scripting data, not having to tell the chain all of the crap that you're doing behind it. And it's a huge benefit to privacy because you're not showing all of that, all of those explicit paths in the transaction or the Multi SIG or the Lightning channel or whatever the hell it is you're doing to the transparent public blockchain. You're using it for the very thing that it's supposed to be used for securing the monetary policy period and securing the monetary policy and the ownership of the coins. And you don't have to show who's owning it or who has the signature power or who has the backup and the insurance clause in that signature power. You don't need any of that. And Tap root turns all of that into a single public key and a single signature. It hides all of it with Mast, with the mercalized abstract syntax trees, blah blah, where you create this off of the transaction, off of the chain, everything. You create this tree of possible paths that you have of the multi signal contracts in the Lightning case, you have the cooperative close potential, the insurance closed potential, and the punishment clause, you have these three different branches. Well, you put all that together and you give the root hash of all of that and mix that with the signatures and produce one public key and one signature, and it looks identical to any other one to one transaction on the chain period. You see none of it, and therefore, also you have to validate none of it. You. Just check the hash, you just boom it. Validation becomes so freaking cheap. And the ability, the things that you can do with that are you just open up a whole new world and you can really start to breaking down like one UTXO into ownership of many different parties. You really simplify, splicing in and splicing out of all the Lightning Channel opening, closing, splicing looping, all of that shit becomes so much easier, more private, more private. Lightning Network goes completely dark. You can't even use a Lightning Network Explorer anymore. You can't look at the chain and know what's Lightning and what's not, which kind of sucks, but it's awesome. And what's funny is that it actually doesn't come with the usual trade offs. Usually you get one benefit at the cost of something else, or it takes a little bit longer to validate, but you get all these great features in the transaction, or you get all these awesome features, but it costs a little bit more in data. Usually there's always something that is the negative side of it, and Taproot has managed to almost have no negative. I think the only thing is that to do a certain type of transaction or to differentiate it, it takes like one bit, like literally one bit or one bite. I can't remember what it was. And they had to decide where and how exactly to put in that bite to kind of mitigate that one thing. And that was actually contentious, believe it or not, to figure out how to manage that one tiny little difference. Love it. But it's just good across the board, better for efficiency, better for the block space, and better for privacy. And if we can get that into the bitcoin code base. I think what we can do with that opens up enough possibility that bitcoin could work almost indefinitely with a layer two and layer three protocols and be incredibly secure. Not open us up to all these new risks and still be pretty damn feature rich and get back enough privacy at the base layer to enable privacy for the normal retail payment system. For a global payment system. Yeah. So awesome, man. I mean, can you give us a couple of examples of proposals that are reliant on the Top Group software? Well, I'm not sure if signature aggregation, because it's more signatures, is kind of the base of Tap root. So it's like VIP 391-4141 I can't remember. I can't remember what the numbers are, but it's like three of them in one sats root, and then the verification and then Snore signatures and Mast, I. Think, is in there too. Yeah. Really? All the proposals that are wait a second. Is the vault actually a consequence of do you know the callback function? Like the vault? Is that from a different opcode? Is that from oh, God, I should have read about this again recently. It's been a long time since I since I read mastering bitcoin that's been taken many years. So I put most of that information aside, the details of the opcodes and everything. Yeah, ",

Usually you get one benefit at the cost of something else, or it takes a little bit longer to validate, but you get all these great features in the transaction, or you get all these awesome features, but it costs a little bit more in data. Usually there's always something that is the negative side of it, and Taproot has managed to almost have no negative. I think the only thing is that to do a certain type of transaction or to differentiate it, it takes like one bit, like literally one bit or one bite. I can't remember what it was. And they had to decide where and how exactly to put in that bite to kind of mitigate that one thing. And that was actually contentious, believe it or not, to figure out how to manage that one tiny little difference. Love it. But it's just good across the board, better for efficiency, better for the block space, and better for privacy. And if we can get that into the bitcoin code base. I think what we can do with that opens up enough possibility that bitcoin could work almost indefinitely with a layer two and layer three protocols and be incredibly secure. Not open us up to all these new risks and still be pretty damn feature rich and get back enough privacy at the base layer to enable privacy for the normal retail payment system. For a global payment system. Yeah. So awesome, man. I mean, can you give us a couple of examples of proposals that are reliant on the Top Group software? Well, I'm not sure if signature aggregation, because it's more signatures, is kind of the base of Tap root. So it's like VIP 391-4141 I can't remember. I can't remember what the numbers are, but it's like three of them in one sats root, and then the verification and then Snore signatures and Mast, I. Think, is in there too. Yeah. Really? All the proposals that are wait a second. Is the vault actually a consequence of do you know the callback function? Like the vault? Is that from a different opcode? Is that from oh, God, I should have read about this again recently. It's been a long time since I since I read mastering bitcoin that's been taken many years. So I put most of that information aside, the details of the opcodes and everything. Yeah, ",

Remember, all that a channel is is a set of pre signed transactions to lay the foundation for future privacy improvements. One of those is the shift away from hash time lock contracts to point timelock contracts or PTLCs. Currently, HTLCs are what guarantee that a payment either succeeds or fails for every hop along a payment route, the pre image to the hash lock is released and guarantees the payment goes through for everyone, or it doesn't, and is refunded for everyone. PTLCs accomplish the same thing using adapter signatures instead of hashes, which means that every hop along the path does not have the same hash, which could identify a single payment across multiple hops if one person is running multiple nodes along the payment path. While this by no means is a magic privacy solution for the network, it is a building block toward comprehensive privacy once other solutions are implemented. The next step after implementing Taproot channels for Lightning is updating the channels live on the network to use them. There are 82 697 public Lightning channels as of this writing, with close to the most efficient use of blockspace containing around 3300 transactions. That would take 25 blocks of just channel closures to close them all out and another 25 to reopen them as Taproot channels. Let's assume that there are twice as many private channels as there are public ones. This would bring the total to around 150 blocks to close out and reopen all existing Lightning channels as Taproot channels, assuming the blocks are filled with no other transactions. In reality though, those blocks are not going to be full of just Lightning transactions, so this process could take a week or more for the entire network to cycle through an upgrade. LND is planning to implement a feature called on the Fly Channel Updates, where instead of closing existing channels and opening new ones, you simply spend the existing channel state pre signed transaction into a new one instead of into outputs that would close the channel on the chain. This comes at the cost of an extra transaction for non cooperative closes, but would allow node operators to take advantage of new tap rootbased features without having to close existing channels. Obviously, the implementation of Taro will likely take a front seat at some point after these developments, but the implementation of a brand new top layer token protocol will likely take some significant amount of time. Given other features that might be a good idea to implement, as well as the day to day work of optimizing the nodes existing functionality, I don't think there's any telling how long until that sees the light of day.

    text: "is that that is the power that you can do with Taproot. So the amount of complexity and branching that you can do within this and the number of different data structures and metadata and time locks and alternatives and various keys that you can do and stack within a single signature is unbounded. You can do it practically indefinitely. And that is a fascinating thing. And we just don't understand all of the things that will be possible to build with that. When you can start to create these sorts of arrangements, you could have a federated set up within a single key. There's a serious potential that you could run side chains like this. And god, it's so crazy. It's so crazy how much this is going to move very quickly. And I think every shit coin that has boasted that, oh, we can run stable coins on top of us, and that was damn near their claim to fame, is going to be in a bad spot. It's going to be in really bad spot because like it or not, it's coming back to bitcoin. Now, the trade offs, what's the danger? What's the risk of having non bitcoin assets issued on bitcoin? This is where things get kind of hairy because it's a bittersweet, right? There's a lot of great things that can happen with this. Credit is not going anywhere. Credit is a critical part of any economy. And to be able to issue credit for a business, or equity for a business, well, I mean, it's a clear use case. It's a clearly valuable thing that an economy needs. And I think it makes sense that we would end up using bitcoin as the consensus model for this, as the double spend protection, like as the time chain. That is what bitcoin does. That is fundamentally the power of this technology. So it makes sense that it ends up there. But when you end up in a contentious situation, when you end up in a block size war, assets that must be scarce necessarily, like equity or whatever, it becomes a risk, it becomes an unknown factor or an increasingly mode of influence over which direction the bitcoin network takes. So during a contentious hard fork, you have a problem. Imagine if coinbase had issued USDC, $100 million, a billion dollars worth of USDC onto the bitcoin chain before the block size war, and then doubled down and said we were only going to support big block bitcoin. Well, when bitcoin forks, those stable coins exist on both chains at the same time, there's, quote, unquote, excuse me, a billion dollars on Coinbase bitcoin. They now have an incredible amount of influence over which network or which fork becomes the quote unquote accepted or dominant one, because they can make a billion dollars worth of value that people within the bitcoin space are holding vanish because they only have a billion dollars if they're one to one. If they're actually fully reserved, which they're coinbase, I wouldn't trust them to do that. But regardless, they're supposed to have a reserve of a billion dollars for a billion dollars in stablecoin If there's now $2 billion in stable coins on two separate forks of the same network, they have to pick which one that billion dollars exists on. So this is a risky trade off. Now, the reason it might not be as much undue influence as it may seem like at first, is that the underlying value and for the same reason that Tether being on Tron is not a risk to bitcoin right now, they could say, oh, we're only going to use Tron. It's like nobody cares, right? The value of bitcoin remains the value of bitcoin. And if we decide which Lightning network is the one we're running nodes for. And we decide and this is actually kind of the beauty of Taro over Omni in the situation of this or in the scenario of this hard fork. This imagined hard fork with Coinbase Coin. Is that I will not keep my node running for a Lightning network on Coinbase bitcoin. Right. Is that my Lightning network is going to have a bunch of nodes and excuse me. It's going to have a bunch of channels and a bunch of liquidity. And I'm going to have multiple things. And I'm going to accept Lightning payments and stuff from other merchants. And I'm going to pay merchants and I'm going to pay people like other peers and all this stuff. But when the network forks, I'm not going to spin up a shit Coin, I'm not going to spin up a Be cash node and run my Lightning network over there. So they will not be able to settle through my node, their Taro stablecoin, their USDC will not longer get the benefit of my liquidity. Whereas on Omni is that if I have a explicitly stable Coin channel, well, then they can just make that channel disappear for me. So my channel just will only exist on one of those coins. Whereas when we're looking at bitcoin as the settlement layer. Well. Then you've still got this user activated Softwork sort of calling their bluff. Where if the Lightning network does not the Lightning network infrastructure does not support their fork. Well. Then it doesn't matter if that billion dollars of stablecoin disappears because everybody's just going to dump it for somebody else's stablecoin or for bitcoin on the Lightning network. That will actually settle their payment because the Lightning network becomes useless. If all of the nodes running the Lightning settlement layer, running Lightning nodes and opening up and maintaining all these channels ignores their chain. It's not like a set in stone like, oh God, this makes Coinbase just control things. But it is an interesting new dynamic.

But when you're paying fees to a side block or whatever, is that you're altering the fundamental incentives? Not a lot. But if more people are using the drive chain as opposed to the base layer. And let's say there are 10%. 20% of fees on that side chain and that side chain has huge blocks. Gigabyte blocks. Well. Then the maintainers of that side chain. The quote unquote nodes that do exist on that side chain can essentially reject or lie about what the accurate fee is to any of the Light clients. And in doing so, they can essentially make mining unprofitable for anybody who is not also mining the side chain.

I think stablecoins are a net benefit to the banking system, to a world that needs to transition to Bitcoin. And like I said, I've always liked the idea that we would kind of bifurcate and turn back into a banknote system where credit from banks were priced individually, were priced in isolation of each other, where each bank had their own stablecoin I think that is a far better and easier to keep the incentives right for a banking system than our current one.

      text: "is that that is the power that you can do with Taproot. So the amount of complexity and branching that you can do within this and the number of different data structures and metadata and time locks and alternatives and various keys that you can do and stack within a single signature is unbounded. You can do it practically indefinitely. And that is a fascinating thing. And we just don't understand all of the things that will be possible to build with that. When you can start to create these sorts of arrangements, you could have a federated set up within a single key. There's a serious potential that you could run side chains like this. And god, it's so crazy. It's so crazy how much this is going to move very quickly. And I think every shit coin that has boasted that, oh, we can run stable coins on top of us, and that was damn near their claim to fame, is going to be in a bad spot. It's going to be in really bad spot because like it or not, it's coming back to bitcoin. Now, the trade offs, what's the danger? What's the risk of having non bitcoin assets issued on bitcoin? This is where things get kind of hairy because it's a bittersweet, right? There's a lot of great things that can happen with this. Credit is not going anywhere. Credit is a critical part of any economy. And to be able to issue credit for a business, or equity for a business, well, I mean, it's a clear use case. It's a clearly valuable thing that an economy needs. And I think it makes sense that we would end up using bitcoin as the consensus model for this, as the double spend protection, like as the time chain. That is what bitcoin does. That is fundamentally the power of this technology. So it makes sense that it ends up there. But when you end up in a contentious situation, when you end up in a block size war, assets that must be scarce necessarily, like equity or whatever, it becomes a risk, it becomes an unknown factor or an increasingly mode of influence over which direction the bitcoin network takes. So during a contentious hard fork, you have a problem. Imagine if coinbase had issued USDC, $100 million, a billion dollars worth of USDC onto the bitcoin chain before the block size war, and then doubled down and said we were only going to support big block bitcoin. Well, when bitcoin forks, those stable coins exist on both chains at the same time, there's, quote, unquote, excuse me, a billion dollars on Coinbase bitcoin. They now have an incredible amount of influence over which network or which fork becomes the quote unquote accepted or dominant one, because they can make a billion dollars worth of value that people within the bitcoin space are holding vanish because they only have a billion dollars if they're one to one. If they're actually fully reserved, which they're coinbase, I wouldn't trust them to do that. But regardless, they're supposed to have a reserve of a billion dollars for a billion dollars in stablecoin If there's now $2 billion in stable coins on two separate forks of the same network, they have to pick which one that billion dollars exists on. So this is a risky trade off. Now, the reason it might not be as much undue influence as it may seem like at first, is that the underlying value and for the same reason that Tether being on Tron is not a risk to bitcoin right now, they could say, oh, we're only going to use Tron. It's like nobody cares, right? The value of bitcoin remains the value of bitcoin. And if we decide which Lightning network is the one we're running nodes for. And we decide and this is actually kind of the beauty of Taro over Omni in the situation of this or in the scenario of this hard fork. This imagined hard fork with Coinbase Coin. Is that I will not keep my node running for a Lightning network on Coinbase bitcoin. Right. Is that my Lightning network is going to have a bunch of nodes and excuse me. It's going to have a bunch of channels and a bunch of liquidity. And I'm going to have multiple things. And I'm going to accept Lightning payments and stuff from other merchants. And I'm going to pay merchants and I'm going to pay people like other peers and all this stuff. But when the network forks, I'm not going to spin up a shit Coin, I'm not going to spin up a Be cash node and run my Lightning network over there. So they will not be able to settle through my node, their Taro stablecoin, their USDC will not longer get the benefit of my liquidity. Whereas on Omni is that if I have a explicitly stable Coin channel, well, then they can just make that channel disappear for me. So my channel just will only exist on one of those coins. Whereas when we're looking at bitcoin as the settlement layer. Well. Then you've still got this user activated Softwork sort of calling their bluff. Where if the Lightning network does not the Lightning network infrastructure does not support their fork. Well. Then it doesn't matter if that billion dollars of stablecoin disappears because everybody's just going to dump it for somebody else's stablecoin or for bitcoin on the Lightning network.

And dives into the Lightning Network that you can get. And it's pretty damn thorough and amazing. So I highly recommend all of that stuff. I'll have those links in the show notes along with the Bitcoin Magazine article. But let's talk about Taproot So this piece goes through. There's a lot of people working on these Snore and Tap Root proposals right now, and it's kind of funny that all these things were slowly piled on top of each other and kind of doing the work on all of these softwares. We've got multiple layers of additional use of this technology because Mast is a huge improvement in and of itself. So let's go back to the beginning. I'm going to kind of re explain, hopefully more simply, some of these things. I know, particularly in audio. Hearing all of these terms can make it really confusing to follow. But P2WSA paid to script hash. It just means that you are paying to hash just a fingerprint of some other data that is required to unlock it and that includes a signature and a script typically well, the script is almost always just this person must sign but it can include any amount of complexity that you want. But because you have to reveal all of the script to unlock those coins because what happens is that when I send the coins to their new location they just go and they're locked with the hash. They're locked with the fingerprint of a lot of data and then in order to then unlock that hash. You have to present all of the data that it is the fingerprint of. So it's a cost savings when locking up the coins but it's not a cost savings at all when you unlock the coins because it just changes when you have to broadcast that information to the network because before it was the person who sent the coins was needed in order to or was needing to put all of the different instructions on chain as to how to unlock them. And now it's the person who unlocks the coins that has to give all that information. Which actually makes sense when you think about it because the person getting the security of that complex script who's reaping the benefits of it or utilizing whatever service or smart contract inside of it is the person redeeming it, not the person that's creating it. So it makes sense that we would want the cost on that side of the equation, the receiver rather than the sender. So just in a normal like sorting out the economics of it, that's actually kind of important in my opinion. But again, it doesn't really do anything for privacy or just cost effectiveness overall, just kind of putting the cost for the cost should be that was implemented in 2012 ish, and I can't remember exactly when, but then Mast is a new proposal that is not implemented yet.

If enough users switch to such alternative clients, even if there are Lot False clients, tap Root could activate without Bitcoin Core's involvement. Bitcoin Core could then release a Tap Root compatible version of its software once the rest of the network has upgraded. This is similar to how some alternative Bitcoin clients like the Bitcoin have historically adopted protocol upgrades. Or perhaps a new possibility will present itself. Authors note some of the arguments and scenarios described in the article are simplified for the sake of readability. In the event of a chain split, more factors could affect the outcome, while a lack of consensus on lot true or lot false could also result in smaller but still harmful disturbances than the ones described.

He does such a good job of breaking down the technical stuff and we've done shit, I don't know, 15 of his pieces on the show. We have a big list of Aaron bombardom articles, so definitely check out some of the other stuff that he's done. He's had a great breakdown of SegWit and the whole history there the history of P2WSA another major soft fork that kind of had some contentious issues going on and how that was resolved. He has a great piece on Tap route breaking down what that is exactly for everybody who doesn't know. I'll have that link in the show notes, so you can check it out. Let's take a quick break real fast and then I kind of want to give my version on this. I'll tell you whether or not I want lot true or lot false and we'll get into it a little bit before we close this one out really fast. Let's hit our sponsor and we'll come right back.

If enough users switch to such alternative clients, even if there are Lot False clients, tap Root could activate without Bitcoin Core's involvement. Bitcoin Core could then release a Tap Root compatible version of its software once the rest of the network has upgraded. This is similar to how some alternative Bitcoin clients like the Bitcoin have historically adopted protocol upgrades. Or perhaps a new possibility will present itself. Authors note some of the arguments and scenarios described in the article are simplified for the sake of readability. In the event of a chain split, more factors could affect the outcome, while a lack of consensus on lot true or lot false could also result in smaller but still harmful disturbances than the ones described. To keep up with the Taproot activation process, the Bitcoin dev mailing list and the hashtag Taproot activation channel on free. Note IRC are currently the most relevant discussion channels. By Aaron Von Wordham. Another great breakdown. I've really depend on Aaron Von Wordham a lot for breaking these down for the average Bitcoin er and reader. And I keep up with Bitcoin Optech, which is another wonderful resource for this sort of thing. And I highly encourage you to read all of Aaron Van Vertem stuff. He does such a good job of breaking down the technical stuff and we've done shit, I don't know, 15 of his pieces on the show. We have a big list of Aaron bombardom articles, so definitely check out some of the other stuff that he's done. He's had a great breakdown of SegWit and the whole history there the history of P2WSA another major soft fork that kind of had some contentious issues going on and how that was resolved. He has a great piece on Tap route breaking down what that is exactly for everybody who doesn't know. I'll have that link in the show notes, so you can check it out. Let's take a quick break real fast and then I kind of want to give my version on this. I'll tell you whether or not I want lot true or lot false and we'll get into it a little bit before we close this one out really fast. Let's hit our sponsor and we'll come right back. The economy will have to shift to a better, more reliable monetary foundation in order to get us out of this extraordinary mess. Why not get a head start and switch to your own Bitcoin standard with Level Co LVL Bitcoin Mobile Banking Services. They are a free exchange with direct deposit, wire and ACH transfers, checks and debit card. And that's in the free version. For just $9 a month you get even more a world debit card personal banker to chat with and even more benefits. They are in 28 states right now and you can check out if you are one of the lucky mofos living in one@guyswan.com level. And they are planning to make their way to the rest of the US except New York by the end of this year. So stay tuned. That is level. Co Mobile Banking Serviceservices@guyswancom. Level, why are you wasting time? Start living in a Bitcoin denominated future today. So, per usual, aaron Von Wardom gives us a really great breakdown of what's going on here.

So me, you, Cory, Jan, we could all have a transaction where we are batching together and usually we would have to sign every single UTXO.

    text: "there's a quote by which obviously Taproot and Snore go even further steps into making that really a reality in the full sense of it's just one signature. Even the multi SIG itself is one signature. The time lock is just one signature that really takes it to a whole nother level, whereas this is basically manipulating the individual signatures. But this is kind of the beauty of Bitcoin and the restrictions as to what building blocks to use. Andrew Pollstra has a great talk about Taproot and Snore, which I can't quite remember which one it's on. I think he's probably mentioned this on a couple of podcasts too, that I've listened to. But innovation in cryptography, like building new cryptographic systems, isn't like a huge problem. Like, after you have the cryptographic building blocks, you don't really change those much. You don't change ECDSA, you just start writing code around it. But to have a restriction, a constraint that says, all right, well, now you can start building with this. But the only thing that you can output is a key and a signature that you can't have, like a contract, you can have this huge list of trees and architecture of an agreement and all of this stuff. The output just has to be a signature. He talks about how that's kind of insane to even suggest that you could build on something build something like that in that environment, like this opposite thinking, like, oh, well, you start with signatures and keys and stuff, and then you can build all of this stuff. But what about building all of these things where the output itself is just a signature and a key? Like building before the keys rather than after?

      text: "there's a quote by which obviously Taproot and Snore go even further steps into making that really a reality in the full sense of it's just one signature. Even the multi SIG itself is one signature. The time lock is just one signature that really takes it to a whole nother level, whereas this is basically manipulating the individual signatures. But this is kind of the beauty of Bitcoin and the restrictions as to what building blocks to use. Andrew Pollstra has a great talk about Taproot and Snore, which I can't quite remember which one it's on. I think he's probably mentioned this on a couple of podcasts too, that I've listened to. But innovation in cryptography, like building new cryptographic systems, isn't like a huge problem. Like, after you have the cryptographic building blocks, you don't really change those much. You don't change ECDSA, you just start writing code around it. But to have a restriction, a constraint that says, all right, well, now you can start building with this. But the only thing that you can output is a key and a signature that you can't have, like a contract, you can have this huge list of trees and architecture of an agreement and all of this stuff. The output just has to be a signature. He talks about how that's kind of insane to even suggest that you could build on something build something like that in that environment, like this opposite thinking, like, oh, well, you start with signatures and keys and stuff, and then you can build all of this stuff. But what about building all of these things where the output itself is just a signature and a key? Like building before the keys rather than after? In a sense, maybe that's a little bit off, but hopefully the analogy comes across. But he said that if you went to a cryptographer with that level of constraint or restriction, they'd be like, what are you crazy? Doesn't make any sense.

So for every software, there is at least as of the last six, seven years, there is mechanism BIP nine, bib eight. Kind of varies. But the idea is that a software can be in multiple States. It's a state machine. And the first state it would be in is defined and defined just means this software exists, we know about it. Then there's a software state called Start it, and that means that can signal for it. And so that means that when a software gets started, all nodes are paying attention to that signal, and then the. Signal is just a bit of data in the Bitcoin block. In the Bitcoin block, they mine. Yeah. In the header that's just a bit is flagged. So notes, start counting minor signaling. Yeah. And if they're signaling that way before software is in the start state, then that signal is just noise. It's ignored. But there are some nodes might look at that and say, hey, I'm seeing some signaling. I don't understand what this is, and they might want to use it. There might be a software that you don't know about. Anyway, this signaling took place. It crossed a certain threshold, and then it went into the next state, which is called locked in, and it's going to remain in that state until block number 709,632 kwh. Yeah. So we used the speedy trial activation mechanism, which we discussed in the previous episode, which meant that miners had about three months to signal support. And if 90% of minors would signal support within one difficulty period, that means the software would be locked in, which means it would activate later. So that happened last week. Chapel got locked in. And like you said, that means it's going to activate at block 709,632, which is scheduled to be mined in November of this year. No, it's not scheduled, but it's expected to be mined in November this year. Right. The other thing, I guess, is worth noting because we also had the episode about the difference activation mechanism and sort of the alternative clients that did something very similar but slightly different. Without getting into the details of that one, we can just safely say at this point that will also activate Taproot at the same block, presumably in November. Yes. So I would assume that at this point there's no point in running that alternative client anymore. Yeah, I tend to agree with that. At this point, it's probably better to just run Bitcoin Core Zero point 21.1 or any newer Bitcoin Core leads that's upcoming. Yes, exactly. And that's basically for those that don't know that because I've seen some questions about that, people asking how to prepare for temporary or how to get ready. That's basically as simple as it is. Upgrades to Bitcoin Core Zero point 21.1 or a newer version of Bitcoin Core or potentially if that's what you're into some alternative client or implementation that also enforces that route. But I don't know which ones these. Yeah, I think at the moment, Nondo. I know that activation client then. Yeah, exactly. So I think Lip, Bitcoin and BTCD are working on Tap root, but they haven't done it yet. So you can't run their code yet to check for Tap root rules. So this is basically just upgrade to Bitcoin Core Zero point 21.1, I guess is our. Exactly. And if you really want to use the cool features that are going to be in Taproot, like Wallet support, we'll get to that later. But then you're going to need Bitcoin version, Bitcoin Core version 22, which will come out later. But you don't have to do that. I think I can just finish the list of States because we were talking about it. So it starts with defined, then it's started, then it's locked in, which is where we're now, then it becomes active and active just means what you think it means. The rules apply and that's what's going to happen. And it's going to stay there forever.

    text: "works. But you have to write down all of that into the transaction. All of that script has to be included in the signature data. And the more complex stuff you do, the bigger and bulkier that data gets. And it can get really obnoxious, really fast. Tap root is a protocol upgrade that turns all of that scripting data even if it has 1000 different branches of failsafes and backups and what if clauses after six months and blah, blah shrinks it all down into a single uniform sized signature. So this not only provides extraordinary data savings for more complex smart contracts, which is pretty relevant right now, with fees being pretty huge. I think the median fee right now is like $16 or something, but it also creates privacy in what the actual contract is doing. So you might have like seven or eight other parties, like your lawyer, a secondary business relationship. The number of things that you could have in a bitcoin contract are basically limitless, but you might not want to broadcast to the whole world that they're even involved. Like you don't want everybody to just be able to see that and all the potential backups and branches and attack vectors of who owns what just by looking at your transaction. And if it's all hidden in a Taproot signature, none of it is visible. Even in the case of that complicated Lightning contract, it looks exactly the same as if you were just sending one amount of bitcoin to one person. The signature looks identical. It's a really powerful improvement to bitcoin, and it even has the potential to make it down the road so that you can actually batch with other people. So, yes, we can uniform our signatures down to one basic signature, even with a complex script. But then you could actually take hundreds of different signatures of different parties and compress those already compressed signatures down into just one signature as well. So this could create another multiple when it comes to data efficiency with batching and coin joins and multisig and like a peer to peer batching protocol, like all sorts of things. So there's just an amazing amount of potential with this upgrade. And the second part of the thing I just hit with combining different signatures into one is something that's possible down the road after we have Taproot Tap root makes that available so that's Taproot in a nutshell, and we're about to get the first major part of that on the network live. And right now we're basically arguing about how to turn it on. And that's where this is much easier to cover. But that's where the lot equals true versus the lot equals false thing comes in. I've got a link in the show notes for a read where Aaron covers this whole thing and what it all means. But again, this is really simple. Basically, how do we turn this thing on? And what we're trying to do is we're trying to reach a certain number of nodes and miners on the network to update to the new code before we turn it on, because everybody needs to be on the new rules before it's safe to cut them on. So basically, setting this to false means that we're going to try to activate, but if we don't hit a high amount of adoption miners installing the new code, here the amount that we would like, it just runs out, it just expires itself and we start back at the drawing board and we come up with a new plan. Lot equals true means that if we don't hit the adoption threshold, screw it, let's turn it on anyway, which actually puts pressure on everybody to go ahead and adopt it and make sure they have it installed because there is a cost or a risk to not doing so. Whereas in the other situation, somebody could actually support Taproot or not really care, but then not upgrade because who cares? Like just to be a new sensor, just because they don't want to do anything. So they could slow everyone down and prevent the Taproot upgrade from happening for no other reason than they just didn't want to be bothered. So hopefully that kind of lays the groundwork for now. We're here now we have an argument about whether we want this thing to be true or false. And now there are two separate clients using two separate activation methods. What does that mean? So now I'm going to hand it over to the brilliant Aaron Von Wordham with today's article and it's titled there are now two Tap root activation clients. Here s Why by Erin von Vertem there are now two different Taproot activation paths embedded in Bitcoin software clients. Here is what this could mean for the Bitcoin protocol. Tap, ",

      text: "works. But you have to write down all of that into the transaction. All of that script has to be included in the signature data. And the more complex stuff you do, the bigger and bulkier that data gets. And it can get really obnoxious, really fast. Tap root is a protocol upgrade that turns all of that scripting data even if it has 1000 different branches of failsafes and backups and what if clauses after six months and blah, blah shrinks it all down into a single uniform sized signature. So this not only provides extraordinary data savings for more complex smart contracts, which is pretty relevant right now, with fees being pretty huge. I think the median fee right now is like $16 or something, but it also creates privacy in what the actual contract is doing. So you might have like seven or eight other parties, like your lawyer, a secondary business relationship. The number of things that you could have in a bitcoin contract are basically limitless, but you might not want to broadcast to the whole world that they're even involved. Like you don't want everybody to just be able to see that and all the potential backups and branches and attack vectors of who owns what just by looking at your transaction. And if it's all hidden in a Taproot signature, none of it is visible. Even in the case of that complicated Lightning contract, it looks exactly the same as if you were just sending one amount of bitcoin to one person. The signature looks identical. It's a really powerful improvement to bitcoin, and it even has the potential to make it down the road so that you can actually batch with other people. So, yes, we can uniform our signatures down to one basic signature, even with a complex script.

    text: "it to you. Thoughts on guys topic on Lightning, on things being built during the bear. What are your feelings? Well, I love it. I mean, it's so exciting to see the building on Lightning. I mean, it's just really cool. And you illustrated it perfectly. You don't need a lot of these other coins for this kind of stuff. The foundation of bitcoin is so strong, and I think it's the ultimate cipher punk project and these ideals of decentralization and not having anybody in charge. There's so many revolutionary things about bitcoin that just change everything in how our world works. So it's inevitable that it's going to replace money and then a lot of things that go with money, like Swift. Swift is not exactly money. It's just a clunky, stupid thing that they didn't have anything better to do to move money around. And it's gone. I mean, it's toast. I knew that before the Lightning Network, before it was even invented, it was just as clear as day that there's just no way. And there's a lot of things like that in our world that it's just inevitable to be replaced. So I think it's just a super exciting time to be alive and it's really cool to be in this space. Yeah, it's staggering. Some of the things that have been done and the bear markets are when the greatest innovation comes, right, everybody is asleep. The people that were outside of the space have no idea what's going on. As bitcoin is, you get to be around, experience it, see it happening, see the world at large, not have a clue what's going on. And then the next Bull Run comes, the next hype cycle comes, and everybody's like, the new narrative is like, oh, this is here, this works. And so it was interesting this time around because, like, 2017, the number one concern was scaling. And it's funny because there was still a remnant of that, this Bull Run. There's still, like, the remnants of people being like, oh, well, bitcoin can't scale. You're like, dude, I'm receiving microtransactions from my podcast. What are you talking about? And so it's going to take time to shift. I have no doubt that next Bull Run, if somebody says something like, bitcoin doesn't scale, people will laugh them out of the room because it will be just so blatantly obvious. I think the next turnaround is going to be bitcoin privacy. And I'm very excited on that front in that. In 2017, when it hit a fever pitch, especially early 2017, we had no scaling on bitcoin. There was nothing on chain to make things more efficient. There was no layer two to make things more efficient. Fast forward five years. We've got segued on chain, we've got Taproot on chain, and we've got the Lightning Network, which potentially scales to millions of transactions per second. And that just wasn't even possible at that point in time. And we had no tools from then compared to now. Compare that to privacy. Privacy, I think, is front of mind for a lot of people. A lot of. People are worried that bitcoin privacy is very bad and on chain, more or less, it kind of is. But we do have privacy related tools for bitcoin, a large plethora of them actually, right now. And if that's front of mind, think of the progress that will be made in the subsequent three, four or five years, we'll be in an entirely different place in that period of time. And you'll still have remnants of people being like, you can't be private on bitcoin, but they'll be still moderately mistaken at that point. And then moving forward, they'll be laughably mistaken. So I think it's just whatever the concern is, it ends up being built in some way, shape, or form, and we're already seeing it. And I think moving forward, bitcoin is going to make leaps and bounds in the privacy realm during this bear market. That's my hope, and I hope to see it materialize. And I think it is. It's already there and we're already in a better place versus scaling than we were in 2017. So we'll see how that progresses. But I'll open it up to everybody. I think what I'll start to do is I'm going to start to round it out. But on that topic, if you have any final thoughts or any final thoughts on anything that was mentioned throughout the show, and then I'm also going to give you a challenge as well. We mentioned some resources, so I'm going to throw them out right now. You can't double dip my friends, but if you want to recommend a resource that has been helpful in your bitcoin journey, whether it be a book, an article, a podcast, a video, anything, whatever it may be. The ones that were mentioned were the fourth turning from Bruce when money dies. Both of these definitely worth reading. I have another recommendation I'm not going to mention until the end because I don't want to screw over too many people on their recommendations. If it doesn't get brought up, we'll bring it up again. But The Fourth Turning by William Strauss and Neil Howe and When Money Dies by Adam Ferguson. The first turning is in regards to kind of the cyclical nature of humanity, how we respond to stimuli and crises and so on and so forth, and how we shape our society. When Money Dies basically goes through the conditions that led to and the results of the hyperinflation in Weimar Germany in the 19th, believe, and then which more or less resulted in the Second World War by the end of all of that, or at least in part. So I'm going to jump to Len first, dude. Any final thoughts on anything mentioned throughout the episode and any recommendations for content? So, ",

This is kind of more on the privacy side. And so, for example, if you want to use Lightning, you need to make what's called a two multi SIG. So this has a very specific fingerprint. You can see it in the blockchain data. The structure of the transaction which is seen in the blockchain data, you can tell, okay, this is very likely a Lightning transaction. Not so many other use cases for two of two, there's the multisig addresses. So like a two or three kind of set up where some people think multisig gives you a bit more added security and redundancy. And so you basically need two out of three addresses in order to send funds. And then this will also have a different fingerprint in the blockchain capru will allow these transactions to kind of compress together into what looks like the same address. And so you can't distinguish if it was a Lightning transaction or multi suit transaction. Yeah. And so kind of the push there is to reduce, again, from the privacy perspective, to reduce the number of different types of fingerprints that are observable on the blockchain. And of course that will reduce that will reduce the ability of chain analysis codes to track or to, I guess, put chains of possession between addresses. And then of course there's more to it than that where you can have a lot more complicated types of logic when you send transactions. For example, you can have multiple logix in the same transaction. Trying to think of an example where, okay, you have the certain spend conditions like say, two or three multi SIG, and then you can send coins or you can have a time delay time lock where if this doesn't happen by this point in time, then the single address can spend the coins and you can make quite complicated business logic, you could call it. And all of these will compress down into an address that's also indistinguishable from say, Lightning or normal multi speed, I guess. Keep going, but I think that's ",

    text: "I think really the big benefit to tap it, I don't think there's any even a specific proposal. It's just that everything that we're doing now can be made more efficient, like multi SIG. Right now, multi SIG is, like, a huge burden, but it's kind of becoming the standard. Like, I don't like to have anything, any large amount that's not behind multi stick. I don't even like the idea of relying on one hardware wallet anymore for my security, particularly with the ledger privacy dump. And I've got this new one. Kobo vault. I'm not sure if you've played with that one yet, but it's really cool looking. But I'm 100% sure if I trust it, like, they're a new company. I don't know of anybody who has reviewed the firmware and stuff in these things. Like, it could be a honey pot. They could be trying to steal a bunch of people's bitcoin, but it's okay to use it in, like, a multi SIG. I don't have to trust that hardware while I'm splitting up that trust among multiple. If I do a two of three multi SIG, and that's getting easier. You got a casa, you got, like, blockstream green, you've got a caravan, and all these things that are making this much easier to basically sign with multiple keys, just kind of swap the suckers in and out and hit, approve, hit, approve, approve, and you've got a signature. And because of that, the new security standard is a giant bloat on the chain. And of course, obviously it's a privacy giveaway that you have a multi SIG. Tap root natively has threshold signatures, which are basically the same thing just done with shore signatures and kind of a different mechanism. But it's multi sigma SIG with one signature. And again, all of the tracking of multi SIG outputs and stuff on the chain you're getting to see is like, oh, look, all these people are here's. All the multi sigs that are related to Lightning. Here are all the multi sigs that appear to be somebody's savings account, and maybe even they can connect it to, like, services can easily connect it to you. No, shut up. Alarm. Okay? But a Taproot just hides all of this. I want people to see as little data as possible when they're looking at the blockchain, even though the efficiency is great, it really is. And particularly, like, in validation and stuff because someone who. Someone is talking to someone out the window. I think we've got a delivery here. Hold on a second. This is organic security meat space security. I got to get my gun just in case it's not security. Alarm. False alarm. Nobody's here to murder me. Take all your bitcoin. Which they couldn't. I was deleting. I had my hammer out, ready to. Destroy my transit distributed multi SIG, right? Yeah, do it. I was saying on Twitter, you got to have signs. Like you have security signs out there. Like this house protected by ADC or whatever the security company is called. The one out there says, protected by distributed multi SIG. Somebody comes up to your house for the $5 inch tag and you're like, move on to the next bitcoin. And this guy's got multisick. I don't really feel like kidnapping him and dragging him around to various locations. Oh, Jesus. So that's why it's important guys get on the multi SIG before this thing moons. This thing goes to 200, 300K. Like you're going to make sure and. A little bit of money in bitcoin can turn into a lot of money so quickly when things get out of control, it becomes completely apparent, freakishly apparent, how not good your security is when you had an account that was like, maybe it's only $1,000 or whatever, and then suddenly it's like, eleven grand. Like, who, okay. And you got a hurricane on that out in the water or whatever right now out in the Atlantic. And you're like, holy crap, if this floods, I think I would lose all of it right now. I don't have a proper backup. I don't have another key in another place. And it just feels really good when you really focus and get your stuff behind multiple keys and you know you're protected in a way that if my house burned down right now or if I was kidnapped, like, I have just enough of a key, but not enough of a key that I could always get it back with time and going to another location. But I wouldn't lose it. But neither would I be able to give it to someone else. You know what I mean? Like, I could be kidnapped and I would just be like, you would have to shoot me. I would be like, I can read you the seed of one of my multi six, but all I have is that I have the one key of my multi SIG. I can't give you my bitcoin, and it's like, you're just going to have to shoot me. You're going to have to take me to the bank and the thing, you take me to the other location, just like you're saying. And it's comforting even though it probably means they're going to shoot me. Right? No point, unless they're just a psychopathic murderer. Most people are just in it for the money. There's some major consequences just to murdering people. Most people aren't ready for that. And that one, like I said, it's hard to get away with murder. It will stay that way, especially in an age of decreasing privacy. Yeah. That'S kind of that horrible trade off of privacy. Like, you won't want bad guys to get caught, but you don't want that. Trade off does exist, but obviously I think without a doubt, the benefits of privacy, I think the idea of independence and privacy actually discourages the mentality that creates criminality and murders and stuff like the sound money and personal responsibility. I think so much of the mentality that leads to criminality and stuff is that I'm entitled to your stuff, is that I'm hopeless and I'm not even in control of my own life. Like, so much of it is an attempt to control something when you feel like you have no control. Sound money or I guess poisonous money. Controlled and corrupted money is such a source of that sort of thing spreading throughout society. And you actually kind of see that when you get to these times. When society is bloated and full of debt and all of these things are going awry. You get exactly a huge explosion in that sort of mentality in criminal behavior and violent behavior and all of this stuff. So I think you can't really separate those two. Even though in the short term it appears that privacy and independence and the ability to be anonymous or whatever, all of those things may benefit criminality in the short term, I think in the long term it kind of gets at the root of what causes criminality. Yeah, there was an era before crimefighting relied on killing your privacy. Good old fashioned police work can happen again. Right? And even with Tatrooo, the blockchain is still monitorable and still pseudonymous. It's going to hide the details of contracts and et cetera, which is good, but it's not going to hide identities necessarily. And even if the Lightning network is dark, it's still going to be hard to route massive amounts of money over it. So if you're going to be doing some engaging in some huge international arms deal or something like that, you're not going to be doing it on Lightning. Yeah, it's a whole lot better for them to use the banking system and Deutsche Bank right now to get that done, of course. But there's something really interesting, actually, it's kind of a little bit going too far down this topic, but I think it's in the crypto anarchist manifesto. I don't know if it's the Crypto anarchist or the Cypherpunk manifesto. One of the manifesto talks about how an anonymous system is not a secret system, and it's about allowing the parties involved to disclose explicitly what they want to disclose to the world, what they want the public to know, but that they simply have the option of remaining private. Whereas a secret system is one where nobody knows where you're doing something that you think is wrong or bad and you don't want anyone to know. It like it's your privilege, it's your access. But that's kind of the fascinating thing about something like Lightning is that the transactions are private between you and who you're transacting with. So the old fashioned police work will be going to the person you got a transaction with. And if it was indeed one to hurt somebody or do something terrible or evil or human trafficking or something like that. Yeah, it's the same as transmitting a big old bag of cash to the person who you're hiring to murder somebody. Exactly. But the real world associations between the two parties are going to be there. Yeah, back ",

I think so much of the mentality that leads to criminality and stuff is that I'm entitled to your stuff, is that I'm hopeless and I'm not even in control of my own life. Like, so much of it is an attempt to control something when you feel like you have no control. Sound money or I guess poisonous money. Controlled and corrupted money is such a source of that sort of thing spreading throughout society. And you actually kind of see that when you get to these times. When society is bloated and full of debt and all of these things are going awry. You get exactly a huge explosion in that sort of mentality in criminal behavior and violent behavior and all of this stuff. So I think you can't really separate those two. Even though in the short term it appears that privacy and independence and the ability to be anonymous or whatever, all of those things may benefit criminality in the short term, I think in the long term it kind of gets at the root of what causes criminality. Yeah, there was an era before crimefighting relied on killing your privacy. Good old fashioned police work can happen again. Right? And even with Tatrooo, the blockchain is still monitorable and still pseudonymous. It's going to hide the details of contracts and et cetera, which is good, but it's not going to hide identities necessarily. And even if the Lightning network is dark, it's still going to be hard to route massive amounts of money over it. So if you're going to be doing some engaging in some huge international arms deal or something like that, you're not going to be doing it on Lightning. Yeah, it's a whole lot better for them to use the banking system and Deutsche Bank right now to get that done, of course. But there's something really interesting, actually, it's kind of a little bit going too far down this topic, but I think it's in the crypto anarchist manifesto. I don't know if it's the Crypto anarchist or the Cypherpunk manifesto. One of the manifesto talks about how an anonymous system is not a secret system, and it's about allowing the parties involved to disclose explicitly what they want to disclose to the world, what they want the public to know, but that they simply have the option of remaining private. Whereas a secret system is one where nobody knows where you're doing something that you think is wrong or bad and you don't want anyone to know. It like it's your privilege, it's your access. But that's kind of the fascinating thing about something like Lightning is that the transactions are private between you and who you're transacting with. So the old fashioned police work will be going to the person you got a transaction with. And if it was indeed one to hurt somebody or do something terrible or evil or human trafficking or something like that. Yeah, it's the same as transmitting a big old bag of cash to the person who you're hiring to murder somebody. Exactly. But the real world associations between the two parties are going to be there. Yeah, back ",

These things are like indistinguishable from normal activity on Bitcoin, and they do very general things. And on top of that, as we mentioned, with integrating them with Lightning, I like to think of DLCs as something more like a building block. You can use this with other protocols. It's a way of making payments contingent on things Oracle say. So that's just like add that into your toolbox that already has multifig and time locks and hash locks and point locks. Now you have Oracle locks as well, and you just throw that into your toolkit and move on and build stuff on top of that as well. That is awesome. So I've recently had a few people I know personally who invested in bitcoin just before this major run up, and they've really been riding a rocket down the rabbit hole. So I was just having a combo with somebody who was just like, I need to run a note. I got to get on Lightning. Do I need a raspberry pi computer? What? Hardware wallet, all this crazy stuff. And I'm like, slow down. The first and most important thing you need to do is secure your savings by holding your keys. You need a secure, easy to use hardware wallet. That is the BitBox. Two. It is actually cofounded by a Bitcoin developer, and the team is made up of serious engineers. It is Swiss made. It's a sleek, simple design. The backup is as simple as plug in your SD card, hit the backup button, take it out. The wallet software is super minimal, and it just works. If you have started investing, get a BitBox before it turns into a ton of money, and keep your bitcoin safe. Check it out at Guy swan combatbox. And you all have basically done this. We merged multi Oracle support in yesterday, so now we've got kind of the full feature set, more or less. Oh, wow. So this is basically ready to go. Well, give me a month or two to test it and document it and get the other implementations up to speed and maybe clean up some of the specifications with more examples and stuff. But yeah, at the end of the day, if you really wanted to and you were savvy enough, you could pull down my code and run it and do because we're doing this on main chain. We do an experiment at this point at least once a month, sometimes once a week. We're like, new kind of contract, let's go. And then we just do it on chain internally. Insured bits. You did a contract for difference on main chain a couple of weeks ago. And before that, me and Chris executed a volatility contract on main chain and all these kinds of things. And every time we get a new bit of features, we're like, okay, let's go, main chain right away. And then coming up, hopefully me and Ben will be executing a multi Oracle CFD change. So that will be the next one thing we do, and that should be soonish. What do you think the first application is for this? Do you all plan on running or being an Oracle or something to start off with? Actually, there already have been DLCs out in the wild. So there's a company called Atomic Finance, and they had an application that ran a market for DLCs on the US election. And this was ongoing for quite a while. And they had a nice website. I think that they got a bunch of the big people on Twitter, like Pierre Shard, and all these other people to come and just put things on the book, essentially like, here are the odds, here's the amount. And then anyone could take. And then it was just kind of like this lightweight browser wallet, web wallet that you would put funds into. It was noncustodial, which is great, but it was like you had to move funds into this web wallet, which in the future won't be the case, hopefully. But regardless, it had this nice interface and it was very smooth. We used it, we played around with it as well. Yeah. And then all of those, I assume, in the coming days are going to be executed and those are all just on chain DLCs that actually happened. So this is like some stuff has already been built with it because on the specification side, so I should say there is a big spectrum effort for DLCs. I lead kind of these monthly meetings with a bunch of people all over the world. We've got people from Crypto Garage over in Japan. We've got Lloyd Fornier, who is out of Australia, and he I believe is funded by Square Crypto and he's just kind of an independent developer working on a bunch of stuff, DLC's being one of them. He's the one actually who figured out how to do these Verifiably encrypted signatures using ECDSA. Everyone knew how to do it with Snore already. These are also called adapter signatures, if you've ever heard of these. Adapter signatures are just these Verifiably encrypted signatures. Yeah. And so he's writing a specification right now for adapter signatures on ECDSA, which DLCs are using. Anyway, there's a big spec effort. I can share the link for the repo if you want to throw that in the show notes. Yeah, actually that would be great for the show notes. Yeah. And a bunch of activity. Yeah. Essentially right now things are nearing stable but not quite there. And so part of the reason that you haven't seen as much out in the wild is because things on the Oracle side of things are going to be pretty completely stable in a month or two and we're going to be tagging like a V zero or something like this. And then once that's done, Oracles can publish saying, I'm going to say with the bitcoin prices in ten years on this day, or something like that. And we don't want people doing that before we have a completely stable Oracle interface because it's a huge pain if you have open events that haven't been signed yet to do this migration, it's possible it's just a pain. So we want to save people from that. That's part of the reason why the selection that was such a great use case for the time is because it ended very quickly. It used to kind of an old version of DLCs, but it still worked. And the newer version is better and more stuff to come, I'm sure, from the guys over atomic finance. Questions on DLC Lightning real quick. Yeah. Is that when you're doing that, like, let's say it's like a month before the election and I write this transaction, does that then mean that I'm basically like, let's say my route to you is through Bob. Does that mean that we're locking up money with Bob for that month and I'm essentially paying for one of the whole HTLCs or whatever that will let him pay him an interest rate essentially for holding that money? Yeah. So there's ",

If you have started investing, get a BitBox before it turns into a ton of money, and keep your bitcoin safe. Check it out at Guy swan combatbox. And you all have basically done this. We merged multi Oracle support in yesterday, so now we've got kind of the full feature set, more or less. Oh, wow. So this is basically ready to go. Well, give me a month or two to test it and document it and get the other implementations up to speed and maybe clean up some of the specifications with more examples and stuff. But yeah, at the end of the day, if you really wanted to and you were savvy enough, you could pull down my code and run it and do because we're doing this on main chain. We do an experiment at this point at least once a month, sometimes once a week. We're like, new kind of contract, let's go. And then we just do it on chain internally. Insured bits. You did a contract for difference on main chain a couple of weeks ago. And before that, me and Chris executed a volatility contract on main chain and all these kinds of things. And every time we get a new bit of features, we're like, okay, let's go, main chain right away. And then coming up, hopefully me and Ben will be executing a multi Oracle CFD change. So that will be the next one thing we do, and that should be soonish. What do you think the first application is for this? Do you all plan on running or being an Oracle or something to start off with? Actually, there already have been DLCs out in the wild. So there's a company called Atomic Finance, and they had an application that ran a market for DLCs on the US election. And this was ongoing for quite a while. And they had a nice website. I think that they got a bunch of the big people on Twitter, like Pierre Shard, and all these other people to come and just put things on the book, essentially like, here are the odds, here's the amount. And then anyone could take. And then it was just kind of like this lightweight browser wallet, web wallet that you would put funds into. It was noncustodial, which is great, but it was like you had to move funds into this web wallet, which in the future won't be the case, hopefully. But regardless, it had this nice interface and it was very smooth. We used it, we played around with it as well. Yeah. And then all of those, I assume, in the coming days are going to be executed and those are all just on chain DLCs that actually happened. So this is like some stuff has already been built with it because on the specification side, so I should say there is a big spectrum effort for DLCs. I lead kind of these monthly meetings with a bunch of people all over the world. We've got people from Crypto Garage over in Japan. We've got Lloyd Fornier, who is out of Australia, and he I believe is funded by Square Crypto and he's just kind of an independent developer working on a bunch of stuff, DLC's being one of them. He's the one actually who figured out how to do these Verifiably encrypted signatures using ECDSA. Everyone knew how to do it with Snore already. These are also called adapter signatures, if you've ever heard of these. Adapter signatures are just these Verifiably encrypted signatures. Yeah. And so he's writing a specification right now for adapter signatures on ECDSA, which DLCs are using. Anyway, there's a big spec effort. I can share the link for the repo if you want to throw that in the show notes. Yeah, actually that would be great for the show notes. Yeah. And a bunch of activity. Yeah. Essentially right now things are nearing stable but not quite there. And so part of the reason that you haven't seen as much out in the wild is because things on the Oracle side of things are going to be pretty completely stable in a month or two and we're going to be tagging like a V zero or something like this. And then once that's done, Oracles can publish saying, I'm going to say with the bitcoin prices in ten years on this day, or something like that. And we don't want people doing that before we have a completely stable Oracle interface because it's a huge pain if you have open events that haven't been signed yet to do this migration, it's possible it's just a pain. So we want to save people from that. That's part of the reason why the selection that was such a great use case for the time is because it ended very quickly. It used to kind of an old version of DLCs, but it still worked. And the newer version is better and more stuff to come, I'm sure, from the guys over atomic finance. Questions on DLC Lightning real quick. Yeah. Is that when you're doing that, like, let's say it's like a month before the election and I write this transaction, does that then mean that I'm basically like, let's say my route to you is through Bob. Does that mean that we're locking up money with Bob for that month and I'm essentially paying for one of the whole HTLCs or whatever that will let him pay him an interest rate essentially for holding that money? Yeah. So there's ",

Like, holy shit, how are we going to scale bitcoin? Everything? And the big narrative was, oh, we got to make a million shit coins. We got a fork bitcoin, we got to change it. We had no scaling whatsoever up until around the summer or the fall of 2017. Segue, it wasn't even enacted for on chain scaling. Now look what we've got. We've scaled on chain. We've added segway, we've added Tapper, which will also help a little bit with scaling. We've also added the Lightning Network, which I use literally daily now. I can now receive fractions of a penny minute by minute for people listening to this podcast. There may be somebody listening to it right now, streaming stats to me hitting that boost button as I say it, and just doing little bursts of sats. So the scaling in bitcoin went from no solutions available on chain at all whatsoever, to where we are now, which is like, we have massively scaled in a short period of time. Number one concern for most bitcoin is right now is the regulation coming down the pipe in regards to privacy and trying to get this dragnet going. I just showed you that playlist. We already have all of these tools available to us in regards to privacy. It's far from perfect. There's a learning curve involved, but the tools exist now. When the worry is getting I would say it's mounting quite a bit. Think forward five years. Do you think we're going to be in an even better place than we are now? I think the innovation in and around privacy over the next five years is going to be equal or better than what we've done with scaling. I very much look forward to it. I have to dive into something called Fediments. Jeff Booth told me to check that out the other day. So, anyways, I am very bullish on what's going to happen in the privacy space around this, so I'm very excited about that. Shout out to also the random porn bots that are hitting up the chat now. Maybe don't click that, but just so you know, don't condone that. Anyways, let's keep going here. Just a few more things I wanted to touch on. Again shout out to Nunchuck. Tomorrow is Canada Day. Tomorrow is Canada Day. And first of all, I want to wish a very happy Candidate Day to a number of gentlemen that are very near and dear to me.

Gentlemen, I'm sorry I don't get to talk to you all the time, but I think you guys are all incredible.

And if you have an idea about this, when you think about chain analysis companies, what is the mechanism by which they'll be able to stay in business through Tap root? Because it's something that we don't talk a lot about. I don't see a lot of it on Twitter. I see even in the comments here, people talking to a chain analysis not being able to keep up. They'll find a way. What is the way you think that they'll be able to continue their work? Because it's almost inevitable that this cat and mouse is going to continue. Right. So what are the trade offs here? I'm not sure if you're asking two different questions here. Yeah, two questions. Okay. Yeah, sure. The trade offs. The cool thing about Tapper is not that there are no trade offs. There definitely are some, but it's very minimal. There are almost no new trust assumptions required. I don't think there are no new cryptographic trust assumptions required for it to work. There's a minor thing in that the way that the fees are reduced for Tap route slightly decreases the ability of address to be hidden in a certain way. Right now, you don't pay directly to public addresses. You pay to a hash of the public address. And then when you're spending from that, you kind of reveal what the public address is. And then you have these two pieces of data where you have, like, after you spend from an output, the public address shows up, and then in the output, you also have the hash. Whereas with Tap roots, due to how it works, there is no hash of the public key. You're paying directly to a public key. So that's where the space savings comes from. Now I've seen some debate back and forth on whether or not there's even much of a benefit to kind of hiding your public key behind a hash before you spend it. But that is kind of I do remember that being one point where it was discussed, like, okay, do we actually want to make this trade? That's the only thing came to mind. But there aren't. There is a degree you could argue that there's added complexity and now there's more, other, more output types, more transaction addresses that white wallets will need to know how to handle. But to be honest, those are pretty minor compared to the benefits for getting here. This really was a large work of optimization. The other thing you're asking about was Cha analysis companies. Now, I'm Super stoked for the Privacy enhancements here, but this is not a panacea. I think we really do have to adopt the mindset that there is going to be a constant kind of ongoing war between Privacy solutions and entities that are trying to analyze the blockchain. Right. So this is going to make it harder for them to distinguish between Lightning, network channel opens, and closures. But there's a handful of heuristics that these companies use to kind of make guesses. It'll make their job a bit harder, but it's not going to make it impossible. And also another thing to keep in mind that Privacy doesn't only happen at the blockchain level. We normally think of surveillance companies as like scanning Bitcoin transactions and kind of making inferences based on the inputs and outputs. But there are also different levels where Privacy happens. There are some things that could be done where these companies run their own nodes, and if they run a bunch of different nodes in different parts of the network, and they might be able to kind of tell where transactions were first broadcast from so they can guess where they come from. So maybe more their efforts will shift to different levels, and there's all sorts of work being done on at the kind of peer to peer communications layer for nodes, which we don't often think about because a lot of that just happens in the background. But maybe more of the Privacy efforts will be focused there, more the analysis efforts will be focused there. So I don't think these companies are going to go out of business anytime soon. But we are going to make their job harder, and hopefully it'll shake some of them out, and then hopefully the entity is paying for this data will be paying more money for less info, but I don't think it's not going to be a full Gameover solution.

    text: "that would be good for more privacy is Cap route. Do you think that yeah, absolutely. Will this be implemented this year? I think the code will be merged into Bitcoin core this year, which will be the start of an activation process that can take anywhere from one to three years. It very much depends. I hope we'll do it faster than three years. But nothing moves too fast in Bitcoin for good reasons. Taproot is a very important privacy preserving technology, and it's also building blocks that allows us to build other, even more important privacy preserving technologies. Can you please elaborate on that a little bit? I think it enables page showing and other stuff. Yeah. Taproot is basically a collection of three different technologies merged together. First of all, it's an implementation of Schnor signatures. So as part of the Tapre package is Schnoar signatures, which are signatures that have some unique properties. One of the unique properties is that you can aggregate them. So what that means is, for example, if we have five private keys, five public keys and five signatures, we can add up all of the signatures and add up all of the public keys. So that looks like a transaction created by the sum of all of the private keys and signed that way. So you can't tell the difference between a transaction that was signed by five people in a transaction that was signed by one. This allows you to then take other protocols that use multi signature and hide them and make them look like a simple payment. So a transaction cashing out from a Lightning channel, for example, looks like a very simple payment from one person to another, and you can't tell the difference. That's critical. So Schnor signature aggregation. The second big technology is what's called mercurized Abstract Syntax trees. But basically this is what it is. In Bitcoin, we have a scripting language that allows us to tell you why and how something is being spent. So you can say this is being spent because it's protected by a multi SIG. And here's three signatures which solve this multi SIG. The scripts can get rather complicated. You can say if one of these keys, or two of these keys, or this key after three months, or that key signs. So you have four different conditions as it is now, you would have to show the whole script and then which part of it you executed. Now, the beautiful part of this new Tap roads development is that you can hide all of that script as a tree. That is a Merkel tree with its hash in the script, and then you only show the branch you executed. So you say, well, in here was a thing that said one of these two keys. What else was in there? You don't need to know. It's some of the hashes. You never know what it is. So I'll show you only the part that I'm executing. In fact, even better, using Schnor signatures. I will then take that and make it look like a single signature of a single script. And now you don't know what is happening behind the scenes. So it's a major privacy upgrade. It's a scalability upgrade, it's an efficiency upgrade, yeah. And it's a script upgrade. ",

One public key for a channel that before required multiple public keys and multiple scripts to knock that down back to a normal transaction is a huge cost savings. Wallets, services, exchanges, users, everybody. Upgrading to that is not going to take very long. Again, those economic incentives are aligned with the better privacy option, and I think we'll continue to see that. There's so many other privacy technologies that I think have the same sort of balance. And increasingly, if you look at, just start looking at Taproot by itself, look at Lightning by itself, look at aggregation by itself, look at Coin join by itself. Look at the cross input signature aggregation, which essentially does the Taproot trick. Except instead of for multiple scripts. It does it for all the signatures for many different inputs and many different outputs and it will make a coin join transaction cheaper than a regular transaction. From 100 inputs to 100 outputs. If you do a cross input snore aggregation, like signature aggregation, you'll have one signature on that. Now, we're still a little bit further away from that.

Completely broken any chain analysis from your coins to the coins that got spent at the other end and you did it all atomically. Meaning that you didn't have to trust anybody. Each stage in the transaction was dependent on the previous stage actually happening. Put all of that together, what do you get? That's an incredible amount of privacy. And almost every one of those that I mentioned is also a cost savings. So if these technologies get adopted, if we start using these tools, if we start figuring out where we can apply them, and we make good user experience with these things, well, they'll get used and grant, our anonymity sets will get greater and chain analysis will get increasingly worthless while people who don't even necessarily care about privacy will end up using them.
